		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p title="That's right. I hold two bachelors degrees.">My first formal secondary education is in history education. I earned a BA in History from LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Five years post graduating I went back for more university schooling in computer science and informatics, receiving a BS in Informatics from the Universiy of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2018.</p>

		<h2 title="In order of what I think you'd find most interesting to least.">Interests</h2>
		<h3>Saving Humanity</h3>
		<p>
		Our time in this life is temporary, but humanity's souls are eternal. As a believer in Jesus Christ, I believe that He has given us the opportunity to ensure we spend eternity in paradise with our Heavenly Father. Contact me if you want to learn more about Jesus Christ and the eternal life He gives us or any other questions you may have.
		</p>
		<h3>Art</h3>
		<p>
		I enjoy making things. Lately I've gotten into making informative and fun GIFs. See my <a href=".\skilldemos.html">Skilldemos</a> and <a href=".\fun.html">Fun</a> pages for some demonstrations of GIFs I've created.
		</p>
		<h3 title="Or 'Politics'">Governing</h3>
		<p>
		I find governing and government policy very interesting. I'm always listening to the news to stay up-to-date with the latest events in geopolitics and policy. I also like listening and reading to the history and theory of governing.
		</p>
		<h3>Miniatures</h3>
		<p>
		I really like diaramas, and more specifically I like miniature creatures that live within those small worlds. Most of all I like miniature figurines of the fantasy variety, warriors, wizards, etc. 
		</p>
		<h3>Board Games</h3>
		<p>
		I love playing board games. The game I like the most is Magic the Gathering, but I like playing a variety of board games. Check out my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/profile/JJRshrd"> Board Game Geek profile</a> for more information on my board gaming habits and preferences.
		</p>
		<h3>Video Games</h3>
		<p>
		I like video games in general, but my favorite genre of video games are strategy video games. The video games I find myself playing the most lately are Magic the Gathering Arena and Poxnora.
